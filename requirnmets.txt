#### Node

* - Node registers onto the network by initially communicating with the gateway
 * - Node gets authenticated by the gateway and receives the IP address of the master node

* - Node accepts upload and download requests from the client → chunk

* - Node informs the master node when data is uploaded to it → grpc method?
*  - Node receives IP addresses of other nodes where data needs to be replicated
* -node replicates data based on this  

* - Node must be able to receive a message from the master node about replicating data when 
some other node fails

* - Node will receive IP addresses of other nodes where data needs to be replicated -> node replicates data based on this


  There're two replication scenarios: 
1. replicate after file upload
2. replicate after node failure

The flows for each looks like
1. file upload to node -> node contact master for other nodes' ips -> node call CreateReplica of other nodes
2. Other node failed -> master call nodes' ReplicateFile with other node's ips -> node call CreateReplica of other nodes
