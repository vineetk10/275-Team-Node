#### Node

* - Node registers onto the network by initially communicating with the gateway
  - Node gets authenticated by the gateway and receives the IP address of the master node

- Node accepts upload and download requests from the client → chunk

- Node informs the master node when data is uploaded to it → grpc method?
  - Node receives IP addresses of other nodes where data needs to be replicated -> node 
replicates data based on this

- Node must be able to receive a message from the master node about replicating data when 
some other node fails

  - Node will receive IP addresses of other nodes where data needs to be replicated -> node replicates data based on this
